# EECS442_CV_Proj

This repo is the final proj for EECS442 Computer Vision in Umich F18 titled Document Reconstruction and Contextualization.

//---------
2017/12/02:
Step0: split image in nonrandom size mode (done) and randome size mode (TBA)
Step1: vertical bar reconstruction (done)
Step2: laterial bar reconstruction (TBA)

//---------
2017/12/03:
1. fix the bidirection problem in vertical bar reconstruction bug. Now just start from left side. 
2. go through the cube_cut case. Finished it in full_text case. 
3. Next stage is to improve the performance of reconstruction. And start contextualization (i.e. ocr).

//---------
2017/12/04:
1. Add and test the matlab ocr and text saving. Finish the example. Next step is to make it a general case. 
2. TODO: improve the cubecut performance and prevent mismatching dimension error in programming.
